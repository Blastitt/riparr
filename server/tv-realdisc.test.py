"""Real season discs, from real drives, through the real parser and planner.

`tv-detect.test.py` uses a mock disc built from forum folklore. These are the scans of
actual discs, taken with `makemkvcon -r --cache=1 --minlength=0 info disc:0` on the
reference box and saved under fixtures/discs, next to TVmaze's episode list for the show
as it was on the day. Each one encodes what the right answer turned out to be, checked
against the disc, so a change to the planner that breaks a disc people own fails here.

Add a disc: save its scan and its TVmaze list, then write down what it must produce.

Run: python3 server/tv-realdisc.test.py
