#
# Why this is its own script, 2026-08-29:
#
# There were two ways to get a new version onto a box and only one of them applied
# system changes. `tools/install.sh` copies the systemd units and helper scripts into
# place; the in-app updater (updater.install) swaps /opt/riparr, pip-installs and
# restarts the service -- it never touches /etc/systemd/system or /usr/local/lib. So a
# release that added a unit shipped the file and installed nothing, on every box that
# updated from the web page. The unit sat in /opt/riparr/packaging looking installed.
#
# That is the same shape as every bug in JOURNAL.md worth remembering: something that
# reads as implemented and does nothing. The fix is one definition with two callers --
# install.sh runs it, and the provisioning door (riparr-provision.path) runs it after
# an in-app update.
#
# Must be idempotent: it runs on every install and after every update.

# so Wi-Fi never came back. Not starting hciattach is not enough: the driver's own
# sprdbt_tty powers the chip's Bluetooth side whenever the Bluetooth rfkill switch is
# unblocked, and the vendor unit unblocks everything ("power state:5" -- Wi-Fi and
# Bluetooth -- with no Bluetooth service running at all). So the radio is blocked as
# well. sunxi_addr still loads and Wi-Fi is still unblocked: the Wi-Fi side needs both.
